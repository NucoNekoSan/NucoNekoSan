## Hi, I'm Hideki.

I work on **business improvement and data utilization**, building practical tools with **Python** and **Django**.
I focus on reproducible workflows and clear documentation.

### What I'm working on
- **Personal blog / portfolio** (Django CMS)
- **Reading tracker** (database design + analytics, migrating step by step)
- **Household finance tracker** (data model → dashboards → automation)

### Core skills (growing)
- Python / Django / Git / Docker
- Data analysis: pandas, basic statistics, visualization
- Excel / SQL for business operations

### How I work
- Prefer simple, maintainable architecture over over-engineering
- Keep everything reproducible: README, scripts, environment setup
- Document decisions and processes to avoid knowledge silos

### Status
- Personal projects under active development
